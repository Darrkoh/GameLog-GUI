## 📌 Notes from the Developer

> This app is fully functional and gets the job done, but currently undergoing updates to improve both the codebase (for better readability) and the UI (for a more user-friendly experience, as well as being more responsive). Feedback is welcome!

## 🔧 Installation
You can download the v1.0.1 .exe file [here](https://github.com/Darrkoh/GameLog-GUI/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

When you start to use the app a JSON file will be created. 

**I heavily recommend putting both the .exe file and the JSON file inside a seperate directory together!** 
They will need to be in the same directory at all times for the app to read and edit the file.
